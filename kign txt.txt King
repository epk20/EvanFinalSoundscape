This soundscape is meant to be a spooky trip through a forest. It is not meant to be a story, but more of an experience where you can take what you want from it. It is open to interpretation and the sound is meant to bring some feeling or idea to the listener. I achieved this by layering many sounds over each other to build a sense of forest but also other sounds that build spooky music. I used envelope as a fade tool as well and using it to make a thunderstrike extra loud and the rest quieter.  Other effects I used were change pitch and change speed. I did that to change the sound of the chanting voice to make it deeper and slower. Another device I used was the gain slider on the side. I used this to ensure that all my layers sounding the way I wanted. After talking to other students I got the idea to add footsteps to add more. I did this and really liked the way it made it sound, and it was a very helpful part of the process. With all this I hope to bring across the feeling of walking through a spooky forest, and while the story is not specific I hope to get some feeling across.
